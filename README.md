# Music Genre Discovery & Audio Feature Clustering: Unsupervised learning analysis of Spotify track data
## CSCA 5632 Unsupervised Algorithms in Machine Learning final project by Rylan Turner

## Project overview
This project utilizes unsupervised machine learning to discover latent music genres from Spotify audio features and produces an interesting insight: the analysis of audio features suggest **music exists in just 2 fundamental categories**, and crucially, that traditional genre labels do not reflect audio similarity.

## Key discovery
**114 Traditional Genres â†’ 2 Audio-Based Clusters**

- **Cluster 0 (99.9%)**: Mainstream music spanning multiple traditional genres
- **Cluster 1 (0.1%)**: Specialized music (primarily sleep/ambient)
- **Insight**: Traditional genre labels are more cultural/marketing-driven than audio-based

## Results summary
| Algorithm | Clusters | Silhouette Score | Key Strength |
|-----------|----------|------------------|--------------|
| **DBSCAN** | 2 | **0.299** | Best separation + noise detection |
| K-means | 2 | 0.260 | Simple, effective baseline |
| Hierarchical | 2 | 0.239 | Interpretable tree structure |
| GMM | 15 | 0.011 | Probabilistic soft boundaries |

**Winner**: DBSCAN with highest silhouette score and noise detection capability.


## Problem statement
**Challenge**: Traditional music genres create inconsistent categorization for recommendation systems. A song labeled "rock" in one culture might be "pop" in another.

**Question**: Can we discover meaningful music categories using only audio features, without human-imposed genre labels?

**Approach**: Apply multiple unsupervised clustering algorithms to Spotify audio features and compare results.


## Setup instructions
**Note**: This analysis uses the [Spotify Tracks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset) from Kaggle. 
For full reproduction, download the dataset and place `spotify_tracks.csv` in the project root.
